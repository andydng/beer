						</div>
						<div class="12u">
							<header class="major">
								<h2>Water</h2>
							</header>
							<p>It all starts with purified water. I mean it's only 90-95% of the beers mass so it's kind of a big deal.</p>

								<h2>Yeast</h2>
							</header>
							<p>Yeast is a guy you’ve really gotta feel for. I mean can you image how hard life would be if you’re primarily known for and associated with a disgusting infection? Tough break. But you know what? We give yeast credit where credit is due. Yeast is a eukaryotic microorganism, whatever that means. All you have to know is that yeast, the unlikely hero, is actually responsible for the creation of alcohol within beer. We’ll explain how shortly.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="6u" id="ing">
							<header class="major">
								<h2>Sugar</h2>
							</header>
							<p>Sugar is an equally important player in this little game we call beer, but doesn’t get nearly the credit it deserves. This could be because sweetness isn’t necessarily a coveted quality for beer in the eyes of most aficionados, or maybe because technically the sugar comes from the barley. But without sugar, that little tease, the yeast would never even get involved. But more on that later.</p>

								<h2>Barley</h2>
							</header>
							<p>Barley is the OG of the beer making process. He’s a member of the grass family and is one of the earliest cultivated grains in the world. Dating back to humanities earliest days in Mesopotamia. Once human’s discovered this little guy could be used to make bread and, much more importantly, beer, they decided to keep him around. The world produces an astonishing 130 million plus tons of barley every year. Here’s a fun little look at the world’s top ten producers of barley based on a 2011 survey by the Food and Agriculture Organization. You’ll notice that America doesn’t even ring in on the top ten. Maybe that’s because we’re busy with other stuff. Like being awesome.</p>

							<p>Here she is, the big super star, the smiling spokes person of the beer ingredient family. As anybody who knows anything about beer could tell you, hops are responsible for the bitter flavor of beer. Now they don’t do all the heavily lifting, but they get all of the credit. Hops’ level of bitterness is measured in International Bitterness Units, or IBU’s.Let’s take a second to look at the top producers of hops in the world. Remember when I said America was too busy to be a top ten producer of barley? That’s because we’re over here focusing on being the #2 producer of hops in the world. I told you we love our beer, and in the world of craft breweries, bitter is better!</p>

							<h3>Mash/Coat</h3>						<span class="image fit"><a href="#" class="image"><img src="http://placehold.it/200x140" alt=""></a></span>
							<p>The first step in brewing beer is mashing. This where we coax the sweet, sweet sugar out of malted barley.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="4u">
							
							<h3>Fill/Soak</h3>
							<span class="image fit"><a href="#" class="image"><img src="http://placehold.it/200x140" alt=""></a></span>
							<p>The barley is placed in a container called the mash tun. Grains are soaked inhot water for about an hour.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="4u">
							
							<h3>Sugar/Yeast</h3>
							<span class="image fit"><a href="#" class="image"><img src="http://placehold.it/200x140" alt=""></a></span>
							<p>During this process sugar is released from the grains, the sugar is later converted to alcohol thanks to our good old friend yeast.</p>

							<h3>Spray</h3>
							<p>After the mashing process is complete, the grains are sprayed with a final dose of hot water that helps extract the last of the sugar from the malt.</p>

							<h3>Seperation</h3>
							<p>Once the last bit of sugar is squeezed from the grains, they must be separated from the hot liquid. This process, called lautering, can be completed in the same vessel that mashing takes place in for smaller operations, but larger breweries typically complete this process in a device called the lautering tun.</p>

							<p>At this stage in the process, the hot liquid that we are left with is called wort. Once the wort is filtered it is moved to another container where is will be boiled.</p>

							<p class="slide-left">After the carbonation is added you have genuine beer in its final form! From there it is packaged and then sent out to the hands of the eager drinkers, like you and I. As you have seen, the process isn’t terribly complicated, it just takes the right ingredients, a keen understanding of the process and a gentle touch. Hope you’ve enjoyed.</p>
